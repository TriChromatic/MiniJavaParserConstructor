MiniJavaParserConstructor
=========================

A program that takes deimeters and outputs a (hopefully) functional charAt parser. This is much faster than .split or any other regex based parsing solution. I made this mostly for fun but also I figured someone might find some use for it.

It basically generates a method that parses based on a non-regex way of specifying delmieters.
